1. Avoid unnecessary masking and fill values directly using conditional statements.
2. Use torch.where() instead of masked_fill() for efficient value assignment.
1. Use element-wise operations to avoid unnecessary loops.
2. Consider the mathematical properties of the problem to simplify the calculations.
- Avoid unnecessary variable assignments and operations.
- Use vectorized operations instead of element-wise operations.
- Simplify the logic by merging conditional operations.
1. Avoid unnecessary operations like calculating inverse_normalized_demands multiple times.
2. Simplify handling of negative and nan/inf values in attentional_bias.
1. Combine consecutive operations.
2. Avoid ternary conditions for better code readability.
1. Consider using the inverse of a normalized factor instead of taking the factor itself.
2. Use masking to efficiently set values based on specific conditions.
1. Use efficient vectorized implementations.
2. Handle negative values, NaN, and Inf appropriately.
3. Normalize demands based on maximum demand.
4. Normalize distance matrix with respect to demand.
- Normalize demand based on the total demand rather than maximum demand.
- Handle negative and infinite values more efficiently.
1. Efficiently handle negative values and NaN/inf. 
2. Optimize element-wise operations for better performance. 
3. Use vectorization to improve computation speed.
1. Normalize demands based on the maximum demand for better performance. (Worse code)
2. Avoid unnecessary operations like calculating normalized demands again. (Better code)
