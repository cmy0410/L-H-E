- Normalize demands by dividing by the total demand.
- Use element-wise multiplication instead of division for efficiency.
- Remove unnecessary calculations like setting zero values for NaN and Inf.
1. Efficiently initialize and allocate memory for output matrices.
2. Ensure vectorized operations and handle NaN and Inf values efficiently.
- Normalize demands before calculating the attentional bias.
- Use `shape[0]` instead of `size(0)` for clarity.
- Use `mean()` instead of `mean()` for clarity.
- Use `unsqueeze(1)` instead of `view(-1, 1)` for clarity.
- Normalize demands and distances before performing calculations
- Use efficient vectorized implementation for faster computations
- Handle NaN and Inf values appropriately to avoid errors
- Normalize demands by the total sum
- Check for `nan` and `inf` in a single condition for better performance.
1. Normalize demands using the maximum possible demand that can be accommodated.
2. Use torch functions for handling NaN and Inf values in a more efficient way.
1. Normalize demands before performing calculations.
2. Use efficient vectorized implementations to improve performance.
3. Handle NaN and Inf values, setting them to zero.
1. Remove unnecessary calculation of mean distance.
2. Use max_demand instead of demands[0].
1. Normalize demands by vehicle capacity before calculations.
2. Efficient vectorized calculations and handling of NaN/Inf values.
