1. Normalize demands and calculate inverse demands separately.
2. Use masked_fill_ instead of direct indexing for setting negative values.
1. Consider using element-wise multiplication for the attentional bias calculation.
2. Normalize demand based on the sum of demands instead of the maximum demand.
- Normalize demands based on maximum demand and use vectorized operations.
- Adjust attentional bias for undesired and self-edges efficiently.
1. Use item() method.
2. Update values directly.
3. Avoid the use of NaN and Inf.
4. Avoid unnecessary function calls.
1. Normalize demands efficiently and use inverse normalized demands.
2. Vectorize operations and use inplace masking/filling instead of element-wise assignment.
3. Handle negative values and nan/inf values appropriately.
1. Use inplace operations instead of creating new arrays.
2. Avoid unnecessary function calls to improve efficiency.
1. Normalize demands before calculating attentional bias.
2. Use efficient vectorized implementations.
3. Set negative and problematic values to a lower bound.
4. Consider edge cases like nan/inf values.
- Normalize demand globally instead of independently for each edge.
- Use array indexing instead of np.where() for efficiency.
1. Normalize the demands based on the maximum demand for better scaling.
2. Set negative, nan, and inf values to -inf for more effective filtering.
3. Set self-edges values to 0 to avoid self-loops in the solution.
1. Efficient normalization based on maximum value.
2. Simplify conditions for setting values to -inf and 0.
