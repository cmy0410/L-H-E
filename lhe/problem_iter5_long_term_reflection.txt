1. Prioritize edge selection based on both normalized demand and distance metrics.
2. Simplify operations by combining negative value masking and nan/inf masking into a single step.
3. Streamline handling of undesired edges and self-edges, optimizing for efficiency.
4. Utilize efficient vectorized implementations and handle edge cases and exceptions efficiently.
5. Consider normalizing demands using the maximum demand and derive attentional bias using the inverse of demand and element-wise multiplication.
