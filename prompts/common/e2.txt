{user_generator}

I have two existing heuristics with their codes as follows:
[Code1]
{func_signature0}
{code_1}

[code_2]
{func_signature1}
{code_2}


[Improved code]
Please help me design a new heuristic that is different from the given ones but can be motivated by them.
Firstly, identify the common idea in the provided heuristics. Secondly, based on the backbone idea describe your new heuristic in one sentence.
Please write an improved function `{func_name}_v2`,  Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
