1. Consider normalizing demands based on the total vehicle capacity to optimize heuristics.
2. Optimize efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations, type conversions, and repeated operations.
3. Handle special cases like division by zero, negative values, and NaN/Inf values appropriately.
4. Use efficient vectorized operations and inplace operations for improved performance.
