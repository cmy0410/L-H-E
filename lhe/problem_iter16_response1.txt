```python
def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor, demands: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Get the number of nodes
    n = distance_matrix.size(0)

    # Initialize attentional bias matrix
    attentional_bias = torch.zeros_like(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate the maximum possible demand that can be accommodated
    max_demand = 1.0 - demands[0]

    # Calculate the attentional bias matrix using efficient vectorized implementation
    attentional_bias = distance_matrix / max_demand / demands.unsqueeze(1)
    
    # Set zero values for NaN and Inf
    attentional_bias[torch.isnan(attentional_bias)] = 0
    attentional_bias[torch.isinf(attentional_bias)] = 0

    return attentional_bias
```
In this improved version, I removed the unnecessary calculation of `mean_distance` and changed `np.newaxis` to `.unsqueeze(1)` for better compatibility. The rest of the code remains the same as in the previous version.
