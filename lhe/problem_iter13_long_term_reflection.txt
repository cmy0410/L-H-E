1. Exploit torch library for efficient vectorized operations and handle NaN/Inf consistently.
2. Normalize variables early, handle demands appropriately, and minimize nested loops for performance.
3. Optimize for code readability by eliminating unnecessary calculations, variables, and operations.
4. Consider problem constraints and relevant statistics for heuristic optimization in cvrp.
